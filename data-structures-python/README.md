# Data structures implemented in Python

These files contain some data structure implementations,
including binary search tree, hash table, and heap.
There is also a merge sort implementation for arrays.
There is a small set of tests at the bottom of each file.

These programs demonstrate a basic understanding of Python, data structures, and algorithms.
