# Sprint Manager for iOS

An (unpublished) iOS app which allows the user to keep track of sprints in a Scrum work environment.
This is a barebones implementation, essentially a prototype.

This app demonstrates a basic understanding of XCode, Swift, Interface Builder, iOS settings,
persistent data storage for iOS devices, and the EventKit library.

This folder also contains a ZIP file of the SprintManager for easy download of the entire project.
